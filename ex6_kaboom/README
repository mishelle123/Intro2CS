I discussed the exercise with: Tom, Nissim, stav.  

=============================
=  README for ex4: 	1. Point.java
					2. Circle.java
					3. Rectangle.java
					4. CircleTester.java
					5. RectangleTester.java
					6. Game.java
					7. Mediator.java
					8. KaboomView.java (only if you modified it)

=============================


usage: kaboom.java  
	   implement a simple version of the classic video game Kaboom!.

		

==================
=  Description:  =
==================      
1. Point - 			implements an X,Y coordinate position on grid.
2. Circle - 		Class whose instances represent circles in the x/y plane. 
					Circles can be moved by setting a new center point, 
					and resized by setting a new radius.                                     
3. Rectangle - 		A rectangle in the x/y plane, with sides parallel to the axes. 
4. CircleTester -   tests the circle class and methods.
5. RectangleTester- test the Rectangle class and methods.
6. Game - 			A complete, yet abstract, representation of a Kaboom! game state, 
					including the position of the bucket, the position/direction of the bomber, 
					the position(s) of the bombs, etc.
7. Mediator - 		A mediator between a Game logic and a KaboomView) GUI, responsible for translating timer
					ticks and mouse movements to Game messages, and for graphically drawing the Game. The API does
					not guarantee the exact details of how the game is drawn.
